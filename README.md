## Scripts Overview

| Script                       | Purpose                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `setup.sh`                   | Main installation script with interactive prompts             |
| `setup-dev-environment.sh`   | Creates and configures Podman development container           |
| `build-ghostty.sh`           | Builds Ghostty terminal from source using containerized build |
| `create-ghostty-shortcut.sh` | Creates GNOME keyboard shortcut (Super+T) for Ghostty         |

## Manual Installation

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreluisos/linux.git
cd linux
```

### 2. Run Individual Scripts

```bash
# Setup development environment
./setup-dev-environment.sh

# Build Ghostty terminal
./build-ghostty.sh

# Create desktop shortcut
./create-ghostty-shortcut.sh
```

## Configuration Files

- `ghostty` - Terminal emulator configuration
- `tmux` - Terminal multiplexer settings
- `tmux_status.sh` - Custom status bar script
- `silverblue` - Fedora Silverblue specific commands (work in progress)

## Requirements

- **OS**: Linux with GNOME desktop (optimized for OSTree systems like Fedora Silverblue)
- **Container Runtime**: Podman
- **Network**: Internet connection for downloads
- **Permissions**: Sudo access for minimal host system configuration

## Why Containers for Development?

Perfect for **OSTree-based systems** where:

- Host system remains immutable and stable
- No need to layer development packages on the host
- Easy to reset or recreate development environment
- Isolation prevents conflicts between projects
- Full development capabilities without compromising system integrity

## Customization

The scripts are designed to be modular. You can:

- Skip specific components during interactive setup
- Modify configuration files before running scripts
- Run individual scripts as needed
